Featuring Intent-Oriented design, Native Tensors, and Context-Aware execution.Download Now Read the SpecTrusted by 10+ developersmain.proxIntroductionProXPL (ProX Programming Language) is a modern, statically-typed multi-paradigm systems programming language that seamlessly integrates Object-Oriented, Intent-Oriented, and Context-Oriented features for clarity, performance, and reliability. Born from a vision to combine Python's readability with C's execution speed, ProXPL features a professional compiler architecture, a custom stack-based bytecode VM, a robust static type system, and an integrated package manager (PRM).ProXPL is implemented entirely in C/C++ with zero runtime dependencies, making it ideal for high-performance systems, embedded applications, game development, and backend services. It serves as an excellent reference for learning compiler design and interpreter implementation.Why ProXPL?😊Familiar SyntaxClean, expressive syntax inspired by JavaScript and PythonTrue PerformanceBytecode compilation to a stack-based VM with LLVM backend for AOT compilationType SafetyStatic typing with intelligent type inference prevents entire classes of runtime errorsBatteries Included75+ built-in standard library functions covering I/O, math, strings, collections, and system operationsIntegrated ToolingBuilt-in package manager (PRM), CLI tools, and LSP supportProfessional ArchitectureClean separation between lexer, parser, type checker, compiler, and VMKey FeaturesProXPL is a modern, Indian-origin programming language designed for speed, simplicity, and professional-grade development.Modern SyntaxJavaScript-like syntax with curly braces, familiar control flow, and clean function definitions.ProXPL Icons1100+ File Icons support via the official extension (Material Icon Theme integration).Fast ExecutionCustom stack-based VM executing optimized bytecode with LLVM AOT compilation support.Rich Standard Library75+ native functions for I/O, mathematics, string manipulation, collections, and system tasks.Static Type SystemCompile-time type checking with type inference reduces runtime errors.Module SystemRobust `use` keyword for importing standard libraries, packages, and local files.PRM Package ManagerIntegrated ProX Repository Manager for dependency management and project scaffolding.Multi-Phase CompilerLexer → Parser (AST) → Type Checker → IR Optimizer → Bytecode/LLVM.Async/AwaitNative asynchronous programming with LLVM Coroutines support.Multi-ParadigmNative support for Object-Oriented, Intent-Oriented, and Context-Oriented programming.Developer ToolsCLI with watch mode, LSP for IDE integration, comprehensive error reporting.Memory SafetyBuilt-in garbage collector with mark-and-sweep algorithm.Cross-PlatformFirst-class support for Windows, Linux, and macOS.The 10 Operational Pillars (v1.2.0)ProXPL introduces 10 revolutionary concepts that redefine modern systems programming:1Intent-Oriented Programming:Define what you want (intent), not just how to do it (resolver).2Context-Aware Polymorphism:Adapt function behavior dynamically based on execution context (context, layer, activate).3Autonomic Self-Healing (ASR):Built-in failure recovery with resilient and recovery blocks.4Intrinsic Security:Taint analysis and sanitize() primitives baked into the type system.5Chrono-Native Logic:Data with expiration dates (temporal, decay after).6Event-Driven Concurrency:Distributed nodes and types (distributed, node) as first-class citizens.7AI-Native Integration:Define, train, and run ML models (model, train, predict) natively.8Quantum-Ready Syntax:Future-proof syntax for quantum operations (quantum, superpose, entangle).9Hardware-Accelerated Math:GPU kernel offloading (gpu, kernel) and tensor math.10Zero-Trust Security:Mandatory identity verification blocks (verify identity) and crypto primitives.Getting Started in SecondsProXPL combines Python-like readability with C-level performance.

Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.Video.jsfunction Video({ video }) { return ( <div> <Thumbnail video={video} /> <a href={video.url}> <h3>{video.title}</h3> <p>{video.description}</p> </a> <LikeButton video={video} /> </div> );}My videoVideo descriptionWhether you work on your own or with thousands of other developers, using React feels the same. It is designed to let you seamlessly combine components written by independent people, teams, and organizations.Write components with code and markupReact components are JavaScript functions. Want to show some content conditionally? Use an if statement. Displaying a list? Try array map(). Learning React is learning programming.VideoList.jsfunction VideoList({ videos, emptyHeading }) { const count = videos.length; let heading = emptyHeading; if (count > 0) { const noun = count > 1 ? 'Videos' : 'Video'; heading = count + ' ' + noun; } return ( <section> <h2>{heading}</h2> {videos.map(video => <Video key={video.id} video={video} /> )} </section> );}3 VideosFirst videoVideo descriptionSecond videoVideo descriptionThird videoVideo descriptionThis markup syntax is called JSX. It is a JavaScript syntax extension popularized by React. Putting JSX markup close to related rendering logic makes React components easy to create, maintain, and delete.Add interactivity wherever you need itReact components receive data and return what should appear on the screen. You can pass them new data in response to an interaction, like when the user types into an input. React will then update the screen to match the new data.SearchableVideoList.jsimport { useState } from 'react';function SearchableVideoList({ videos }) { const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState(''); const foundVideos = filterVideos(videos, searchText); return ( <> <SearchInput value={searchText} onChange={newText => setSearchText(newText)} /> <VideoList videos={foundVideos} emptyHeading={`No matches for “${searchText}”`} /> </> );}example.com/videos.htmlReact VideosA brief history of ReactSearch5 VideosReact: The DocumentaryThe origin story of ReactRethinking Best PracticesPete Hunt (2013)Introducing React NativeTom Occhino (2015)Introducing React HooksSophie Alpert and Dan Abramov (2018)Introducing Server ComponentsDan Abramov and Lauren Tan (2020)You don’t have to build your whole page in React.

It was the flexibility, how easy it was to use, and the really cool concept behind Go (how Go handles native concurrency, garbage collection, and of course safety+speed.) that helped engage us during the build. Also, who can beat that cute mascot!” — Jaime Enrique Garcia Lopez, Senior Software Development Manager at Capital One \"A small language that compiles fast makes for a happy developer. The Go language is small, compiles really fast, and as a result it lets your mind focus on the actual problem and less on the tool you are using to solve it. Code, test, debug cycles are so quick that you forget you are not working with an interpreted language. Looking at our code, you see less boilerplate and more business logic.\" — Clayton Coleman, Lead Engineer, Open Shift at RedHat “Go has excellent characteristics for scalability and services written using it typically have very small memory footprints. Because code is compiled into a single static binary, services can also be containerised with ease, making it much simpler to build and deploy. These attributes make Go an ideal choice for companies building microservices, as you can easily deploy into a highly available and scalable environment such as Kubernetes.” — Matt Boyle, Lead Software Engineer at Curve \"In our tightly managed environments where we run Go code, we have seen a CPU reduction of approximately 10% with cleaner and maintainable code.\" — Bala Natarajan, Sr. Director of Engineering, Developer Experience at PayPal \"Tooling has always been a problem with our legacy code base... but we have found that Go has excellent tooling, plus built-in testing, benchmarking, and profiling frameworks.

{"title": "Rust Programming Language", "url": "https://rust-lang.org", "content": "Rust Programming Language Performance Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages. Reliability Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time. Productivity Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more. In 2018, the Rust community decided to improve the programming experience for a few distinct domains (see the 2018 roadmap). For these, you can find many high-quality crates and some awesome guides on how to get started. Command Line Whip up a CLI tool quickly with Rust’s robust ecosystem. Rust helps you maintain your app with confidence and distribute it with ease. Building Tools WebAssembly Use Rust to supercharge your JavaScript, one module at a time. Publish to npm, bundle with webpack, and you’re off to the races. Writing Web Apps Networking Predictable performance. Tiny resource footprint. Rock-solid reliability. Rust is great for network services. Working On Servers Embedded Targeting low-resource devices? Need low-level control without giving up high-level conveniences? Rust has you covered. Starting With Embedded Hundreds of companies around the world are using Rust in production today for fast, low-resource, cross-platform solutions. From startups to large corporations, from embedded devices to scalable web services, Rust is a great fit. Read Rust We love documentation! Take a look at the books available online, as well as key blog posts and user guides. Read the book Watch Rust The Rust community has a dedicated YouTube channel collecting a huge range of presentations and tutorials. Watch the Videos Contribute code Rust is truly a community effort, and we welcome contribution from hobbyists and production users, from newcomers and seasoned professionals. Come help us make the Rust experience even better! Read Contribution Guide Rust would not exist without the generous contributions of time, work, and resources from individuals and companies. We are very grateful for the support! Individuals Rust is a community project and is very thankful for the many community contributions it receives.

Latest News NVIDIA 590 driver drops Pascal and lower support; main packages switch to Open Kernel Modules 2025-12-20 With the update to driver version 590, the NVIDIA driver no longer supports Pascal (GTX 10xx) GPUs or older. We will replace the nvidia package with nvidia-open, nvidia-dkms with nvidia-open-dkms, and nvidia-lts with nvidia-lts-open. Impact: Updating the NVIDIA packages on systems with Pascal, Maxwell, or older cards will fail to load the driver, which may result in a broken graphical environment. Intervention required for Pascal/older users: Users with GTX 10xx series and older cards must switch to the legacy proprietary branch to maintain support: Uninstall the official nvidia, nvidia-lts, or nvidia-dkms packages. Install nvidia-580xx-dkms from the AUR Users with Turing (20xx and GTX 1650 series) and newer GPUs will automatically transition to the open kernel modules on upgrade and require no manual intervention. .NET packages may require manual intervention 2025-12-11 The following packages may require manual intervention due to the upgrade from 9.0 to 10.0: aspnet-runtime aspnet-targeting-pack dotnet-runtime dotnet-sdk dotnet-source-built-artifacts dotnet-targeting-pack pacman may display the following error failed to prepare transaction (could not satisfy dependencies) for the affected packages. If you are affected by this and require the 9.0 packages, the following commands will update e.g. aspnet-runtime to aspnet-runtime-9.0: pacman -Syu aspnet-runtime-9.0 pacman -Rs aspnet-runtime waydroid >= 1.5.4-3 update may require manual intervention 2025-11-06 The waydroid package prior to version 1.5.4-2 (including aur/waydroid) creates Python byte-code files (.pyc) at runtime which were untracked by pacman. This issue has been fixed in 1.5.4-3, where byte-compiling these files is now done during the packaging process. As a result, the upgrade may conflict with the unowned files created in previous versions. If you encounter errors like the following during the update: error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files) waydroid: /usr/lib/waydroid/tools/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-313.pyc exists in filesystem waydroid: /usr/lib/waydroid/tools/actions/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-313.pyc exists in filesystem waydroid: /usr/lib/waydroid/tools/actions/__pycache__/app_manager.cpython-313.pyc exists in filesystem You can safely overwrite … dovecot >= 2.4 requires manual intervention 2025-10-31 The dovecot 2.4 release branch has made breaking changes which result in it being incompatible with any <= 2.3 configuration file. Thus, the dovecot service will no longer be able to start until the configuration file was migrated, requiring manual intervention.

Let's look at how we started, how MDN became the most trusted resource for web developers, the impact it's had on the open web, and yes, there's cake, too. Web APIs CSS Custom Highlight API The CSS Custom Highlight API provides a mechanism for styling arbitrary text ranges on a document by using JavaScript to create the ranges, and CSS to style them. Web APIs Server timing Server-Timing is a part of the Performance API and allows servers to communicate metrics about the request-response cycle to the user agent. You can collect this information and act on server-side metrics in the same way as all the other metrics processed with the Performance API. JavaScript JavaScript resource management This guide talks about how to do resource management in JavaScript. Resource management is not exactly the same as memory management, which is a more advanced topic and usually handled automatically by JavaScript. Resource management is about managing resources that are not automatically cleaned up by JavaScript. Sometimes, it's okay to have some unused objects in memory, because they don't interfere with application logic, but resource leaks often lead to things not working, or a lot of excess memory usage. Therefore, this is not an optional feature about optimization, but a core feature to write correct programs!

{"title": "A List Apart – For people who make websites", "url": "https://alistapart.com", "content": "A List Apart – For people who make websites Skip to content In a world where AI can generate good-looking work instantly, “good” can’t carry the weight it used to carry in design conversations. What can carry that weight are language and actions that reflect what design has always been at its best: goals-aligned, research-informed, constraints-aware, and outcomes-focused. Returning ALA author Justin Dauer explains. While Hitler plotted and Europe crumbled, a motley crew of mathematicians, philosophers, architects, and economists met weekly to invent Computer Science. Mark Bernstein mines this forgotten history for lessons that just might save today’s web from its worst impulses. More from A List Apart Design systems aren't component libraries—they’re living languages. Rigid adherence to visual rules creates brittle systems that break under contextual pressure. Fluent systems bend without breaking. Having both a Design Manager and a Lead Designer on the same team is beautiful, but can be messy. To make it work without creating confusion, overlap, or “too many cooks,” check Michel Ferreira’s Holistic Framework for Shared Design Leadership. Building towards bedrock means sacrificing some short-term growth potential in favour of long-term stability. But the payoff is worth it: products built with a focus on bedrock will outlast and outperform their competitors, and deliver sustained value to users over time. Liam Nugent shows us how. At a time when budgets for user experience research seem to have reached an all-time low, how do we get stakeholders and executives alike invested in this crucial discipline? Gerry Duffy walks us through how the research we conduct is much like telling a compelling story, complete with a three-act narrative structure, character development, and conflict resolution—with a happy ending for researchers and stakeholders alike. Looking to tailor your UX to your individual users’ needs? Colin Eagan and Jeffrey MacIntyre have a workshop framework for you! Ste Grainer takes a brief look at the history of the web, where we are now, and how we can shape its future. In this article, Aaron Gustafson muses on some of the many ways we can—and should—harness the capabilities of AI to create a more accessible world. A List Apart founder and web design OG Zeldman ponders the moments of inspiration, the hours of plodding, and the ultimate mystery at the heart of a creative career. In this excerpt from In Fulfillment: The Designer’s Journey, Justin Dauer ruminates on the past and the importance of keeping an open mind. Colin Eagan and Jeffrey MacIntyre offer a “ground-up” approach to implementing personalized digital experiences that are intentional, ethical, and technologically sound.
